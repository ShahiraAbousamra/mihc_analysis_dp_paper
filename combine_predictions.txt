1. use src_ensemble/combine_pred.py to combine the colorAE and colorUNet predictions
It generates numpy of predictions, each stain channel separately
It also visualizes the combined predictions
The different combinations are: 
intersection of both models predictions, 
union of both models predictions, 
union anchor unet (wherever a stain is detected by the UNet model, take the union of both models predictions)
union anchor ae (wherever a stain is detected by the autoencoder model, take the union of both models predictions)

In the file main, set the input paths (images and both models predictions) and  output paths (predictions and visualizations)
